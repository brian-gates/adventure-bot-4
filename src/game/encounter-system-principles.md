# Encounter System Principles

## Group Progress, Individual Resources

- The team advances or faces setbacks together; main story and world state are
  shared.
- Each player manages their own health, energy, mana, and gear for personal
  strategy and growth.

## Encounter Scaling

- Challenges dynamically scale based on the number of active players.
- Solo players face smaller, manageable encounters; groups face tougher, more
  complex ones.
- Rewards adapt to party size, with group play offering bonus rewards.

## Solo Play

- Solo players can always make meaningful progressâ€”defeating enemies, gathering
  resources, or advancing the story.
- Personal achievements and unique loot are available for solo accomplishments.
- No content is gated behind group play.

## Group Play

- Group play unlocks synergy bonuses, combo moves, and special story events.
- Teamwork is rewarded with extra effects, loot, and unique group achievements.
- Friends can join encounters at any time, and the system adapts dynamically.

## Gear and Playstyle

- Gear changes playstyle: some items excel solo, others in groups.
- Players can swap gear to adapt to solo or group encounters.

## Rewards and Progression

- All participants earn rewards, with group bonuses for teamwork and synergy.
- No penalties for missing group events; catch-up mechanics ensure fairness.
- Shared victories and progress foster camaraderie and a sense of shared
  adventure.

## Social Encouragement

- Social play is encouraged but never required.
- Helping others grants both parties bonuses.
- Shared progress and opt-in assistance make group play more rewarding, not
  mandatory.
