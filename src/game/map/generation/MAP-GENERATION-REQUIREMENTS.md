# Map Generation Requirements

## General Principles

- The map is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of nodes (locations) and edges (paths).
- The map is rendered as a grid with a fixed number of columns (`cols`) and rows (`rows`).
- Each node is placed at a unique `(col, row)` coordinate.
- The map is generated per-guild/channel and stored in the database.

## Node Placement

- The first row (start) and last row (boss/end) always have a single, centered node.
- All other rows have a variable number of nodes, constrained by:
  - **Minimum nodes per row:** e.g., 2 or 3.
  - **Maximum nodes per row:** e.g., 4 or 5.
- Nodes in a row must be placed in unique columns (no duplicates).
- The number of nodes per row should be fairly consistent from start to finish (no rapid fall-off).

## Path (Edge) Generation

- Each node in row N can only connect to nodes in row N+1 that are in the same column, or one column left/right (no skipping lanes, no "big jumps").
- Paths can split (one node connects to multiple nodes in the next row) and merge (multiple nodes connect to the same node in the next row).
- No "X" crossings: diagonal paths cannot cross each other.
- Every node (except the start) must have at least one incoming edge.
- Every node (except the end) must have at least one outgoing edge.
- No orphans: every node is part of at least one path from start to finish.

## Trailblazing/Branching Logic

- Multiple "main" paths can be walked from start to finish, but:
  - When paths merge, they can split again in later rows (merges do not force permanent convergence).
  - The number of available options (nodes) per row should remain within the specified min/max.
- When generating each row:
  - Place the desired number of nodes at random columns.
  - For each node in the previous row, connect to 1â€“2 adjacent nodes in the current row.
  - For each node in the current row, ensure it has at least one incoming connection from an adjacent node in the previous row.
- All fallback logic (for ensuring connectivity) must only consider adjacent columns.

## Rendering

- The map should be renderable as both SVG and PNG, with nodes and paths clearly visible.
- Node labels should be unique and human-readable (e.g., `Node 3,5`).
- The map should be visually balanced, with no long horizontal or diagonal jumps.

## Additional Constraints

- The algorithm must be deterministic if seeded (for reproducibility).
- The code should avoid mutation where possible, use types (not interfaces), and prefer functional style.
- All logic should be easily testable and debuggable, with optional ASCII output for terminal inspection.

## Optional/Advanced

- Support for "special" nodes (e.g., shops, elites, events) can be added after core structure is stable.
- The map should be easy to reset and reseed for rapid iteration.
